Grace is terrific! I had to find a baby gift for a very good friend first granddaughter. I had little free time; I searched baby clothes near me, found Bambino’s World. I called and Grace was so kind and helpful, she made it an ease to select some unique beautiful outfits. She went out of her way to send me a few very good options. She not only saved me the time and pain of choosing the best outfits to make a loving impression; she made it a fun process. Then, she was able to ship the warm gift in one day to my delightful surprise. Now I am back to my day at work, feeling like a huge task is completed and I can’t wait for the new parents to receive the beautiful present. Thank you Grace!!

If you're looking for something that is unique Bambini's World is for you. I wanted to buy a Christmas outfit in August for an infant. Of course that merchandise wasn't out yet but the salesperson went into the stock room and came out with several outfits. After purchasing one, the shopkeeper put it in a box, wrapped it, put a little bow on it and even provided a greeting card. It was an one stop shop.

A great option for casual and special occasion clothing. Customer service was great! Assisted me with any questions I had regarding sizing and color choice/style. Also have super cute accessories and stuffed animals (which my son loved!). Will definitely return for holiday shopping!

Bambini's World is my favorite small business, family run shop from my hometown for the little ones in my life! Even after moving all the way to FL, they still help me with shopping from afar, wrap everything and ship it to my friends and family. And now that I have a little one, I get to shop for her there! Cannot recommend Bambini's world enough!

What a sweet store. Great taste in selecting items for newborns - 7 years. The most beautiful, well made, baptism and communion outfits. They had just what I wanted without me knowing it I was going to get. Will be visiting again soon!

I love this store. Nowhere else can you find unique baby and children’s clothes these days. Sizes infant and up to about 6 or 7 in boys. As a grand mother it is fun to find that special dress , outfit, jacket or sweater.

Went to look at First Communion dresses for my granddaughter. Fabulous experience! She felt like a little princess and bought her outfit. So many beautiful selections. The owner (?) was so great. She gave us space but was always right there if needed. It was a very special afternoon for my granddaughter, my daughter in law and me. (Happened to find a perfect dress for my 2 year old granddaughter as well). I highly recommend!

Went to look at First Communion dresses for my granddaughter. Fabulous experience! She felt like a little princess and bought her outfit. So many beautiful selections. The owner (?) was so great. She gave us space but was always right there if needed. It was a very special afternoon for my granddaughter, my daughter in law and me. (Happened to find a perfect dress for my 2 year old granddaughter as well). I highly recommend!

Bambini’s World is my “go to” boutique for beautifully designed and well-made clothing for children. Each gift that I have purchased for either my grandchildren or children of friends has been warmly and gratefully received....and the toddlers in my life want their parents to dress them in their new outfits right away. From Christening gowns to daily wear to unique gifts Bambini's World never disappoints! I highly recommend this lovely boutique for children.
